## About Me

I'm a hobbyist programmer for the United States.

Any pronouns are fine, though I generally refer to myself using He/Him.

## I'm proficient in...
- [HTML](https://github.com/topics/html) + [CSS](https://github.com/topics/css)
- [Python](https://github.com/topics/python)
- [Java](https://github.com/topics/java)

I don't like using web frameworks. All of my websites are either coded from scratch, or powered explicitly by open source projects.

## I'm learning...
- [PHP](https://github.com/topics/php)
- [C](https://github.com/topics/c)
- [C++](https://github.com/topics/cplusplus)

## Projects

- **[PMD: Tales of Celestia](https://talesofcelestia.com):** I'm the primary developer and founder/webmaster of a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon roleplay forum board, powered by [phpBB](https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb) and [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki).

## Find me on...

- [Mastodon (@flit@guild.pmdcollab.org)](https://guild.pmdcollab.org/@flit)

I'll answer DMs, asks, etc. on these platforms.

I'm also on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/), though my handles are only available on request.
